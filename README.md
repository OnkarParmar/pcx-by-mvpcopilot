# PCX Business Panel - MVP Studio PoC

## Project Overview
This repository demonstrates the **MVP Studio methodology** through a complete Proof of Concept (PoC) for the PCX Business Panel - an Order Management System (OMS).

## MVP Studio Methodology
The MVP Studio follows a **5-stage artifact evolution model** where each stage transforms business requirements into increasingly technical specifications:

```
Stage 1: Business Analysis â†’ Stage 2: Solution Architecture â†’ Stage 3: Implementation Design â†’ Stage 4: Code Generation â†’ Stage 5: Deployment
```

### Artifact Evolution Principle
Every artifact **evolves** rather than disappears:
- **BPMN processes** â†’ Service orchestration â†’ Workflow configurations â†’ Running code
- **Business rules** â†’ Decision tables â†’ Executable logic â†’ Live business processes
- **User journeys** â†’ UI specifications â†’ Frontend components â†’ Live web application

## PCX Business Panel Scope
**Domain**: B2B Order Management System
**Complexity**: 7 interconnected business processes spanning Sales, Procurement, and Operations
**Key Features**: 
- Multi-channel RFQ processing (Email, Website, System)
- AI-powered data extraction and vendor selection
- End-to-end order lifecycle from inquiry to delivery
- Real-time logistics optimization and tracking

## Stage Progress

### âœ… Stage 1: Business Analysis (Completed)
- **Business Processes**: Complete BPMN model with 7 core processes
- **Business Rules**: 50+ business rules with AI automation points
- **User Personas**: 5 detailed personas with user journeys
- **Feature Requirements**: 17 features across 7 epics with acceptance criteria
- **Business Glossary**: Comprehensive domain terminology

**Key Insights**: 
- AI can reduce manual effort by 60-70% in data entry
- Process automation opportunities identified in vendor selection and price analysis
- Complete traceability from business requirements established

### ðŸ”ˆ Stage 2: Solution Architecture (In Progress)
- Domain modeling with DDd principles
- Service interface design
- Event flow architecture
- C4 system architecture views

### âŒ³ Stage 3: Implementation Design (Pending)
- Technology stack selection
- Database schema design
- API specifications
- Infrastructure planning

### âŒ³ Stage 4: Code Generation (Pending)
- Automated code generation from specifications
- Comprehensive test suite generation
- Deployment artifact creation

### âŒ³ Stage 5: Deployment (Pending)
- Cloud infrastructure provisioning
- Application deployment
- Live system verification

## PoC Validation Goals
1. **Artifact Completeness**: Can each stage produce complete inputs for the next stage?
2. **Transformation Viability**: Do transformation rules work in practice?
3. **Expert Effort Distribution**: Is Stage 4 really 90% automatable?
4. **Gap Identification**: What's missing from our artifact evolution model?
